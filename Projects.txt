#Vending Machine

A company has built a machine capable of automating the sale of basic food items.
basic, ie, the consumer selects the desired product, inserts the money into the machine and
receives the product and the change if any.
The computer program should simulate the operation of the machine in two modes,
namely:
(a) User Mode: where the products stored in the machine are listed with their respective
the user can choose which product he wants to buy, and then inform the value entered
the value entered in the machine. After processing, if the product is available, the user
the user "withdraws" the product, as well as his change, which is informed to the user.
(b) Administrator Mode: where it is possible to manage the machine by replacing missing products, list
inventory of products and their respective quantities and list how much the machine has
invoiced and can still invoice.


#1. You have a road connecting several cities. Each town has its own mile marker. Make a program that:
- read several pairs of data, containing each pair of milepost values, in ascending order, of two cities. The last pair contains these two equal values.
- Calculate the elapsed times to travel the distance between these two cities, with the following speeds: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 km/h, knowing that:
T=e/v
t = time, e = space and v = velocity.

#2. The professor of the subject of Computer Programming wants to know, from the final grades of each student:
(a) the highest grade
b) The lowest score
c) The difference between the highest and lowest grade
d) The arithmetic mean of the grades
Make a program that delivers this information to the professor in question.

#3. Make a program that reads three integers and presents them in descending order.

#4. You have 25 sets of values, where each set consists of a student's number, the provisional grade of his practical work, and the date it was handed in. Make a program to:
a) Calculate and print the final grade for each student, knowing that the work delivered:
- until 04/20, final grade = provisional grade + 10 points;
- until 05/02, final grade = provisional grade
- until 05/30, final grade = provisional grade/2;
- until 06/30, final grade = 0.
b) Calculate the average and the deviation of the provisional and final grades.

#5. The number 3025 has the following characteristic:

30 + 25 = 55
55 squared = 3025
Make a program that determines all 4-digit numbers with this characteristic.

#6. Make a program that can help draw numbers for a certain raffle, such program should draw numbers between 1000 and 10000 as long as the user wants.

#7. A music production company wants to plan a series of rock'n roll concerts. Management estimates that at $5.00, 120 tickets will be sold, and expenses will be fixed at $200. At a $0.50 reduction in ticket prices there is expected to be an increase of 26 tickets sold. Make a program that writes a table of values of the expected profit as a function of ticket price, varying the price from $5.00 to $1.00 from $0.50 to $0.50. Also write the maximum profit expected by the number of tickets.

#8. Make a program that reads two numbers in ascending order, and determine how many numbers that are between them are prime.
